## Introduction

This repository includes 8 modules with Jupyter Notebooks created for the Introduction to Data Science Class (NYU Stern School of Business, Spring 2018). Each module includes data, code and description of each task within the Data Science Framework.


## Motivation

The creation and maintenance of this project attempts to show the work that can be done to solve different Data Science and Data Mining problems. 


## Installation

On Jupyter Hub, initially create a new python notebook. Copy the contents of the [first cell of this notebook](https://github.com/jattenberg/SternPythonDataScience2018/blob/master/Clone.ipynb) into the first cell of your newly created notebook. Running this command (the play button on top) will clone this repository. 

To get regular content updates, execute the first cell of the `Update` notebook found in your newly created repository.
