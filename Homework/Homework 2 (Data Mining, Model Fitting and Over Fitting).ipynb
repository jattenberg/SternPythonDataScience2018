As discussed in class, one way to control the complexity of a decision tree is by enforcing that at least some minimum number of examples from the training set populate each leaf. This is set with the `min_samples_leaf` parameter. For `min_samples_leaf` values ranging from 5 to 500 (increment by 5), compute the training accuracy and cross-validated accuracy for a `DecisionTreeClassifier` modeling `\"is high quality\"` using our predictive columns. Plot these two curves. What do you feel is the most appropriate value for `min_samples_leaf` for this problem? "
