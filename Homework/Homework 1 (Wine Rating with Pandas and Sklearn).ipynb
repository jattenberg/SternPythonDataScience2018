As a consultant to MTC, you realize that a main task in the business understanding/data understanding phases of the data mining process is to define the target variable.  In one or two sentences each, please suggest a definition for the target variable.  Suggest 3 features and explain why you think they will be give information on the target variable.   Be as precise as possible—someone else will be implementing your suggestion.  (Remember: your formulation should make sense from a business point of view, and it should be reasonable that MTC would have data available to know the value of the target variable and features for historical customers.)"
