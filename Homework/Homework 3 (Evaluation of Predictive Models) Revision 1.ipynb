Consider the examples above which are taken from a real direct marketing campaign. Each record (X) represents an individual who was targeted with a direct marketing offer. The offer was a solicitation to make a charitable donation.

We've called the labels for the \"use\" `y_mailing_use_secret` to emphasize that you really would not know these.  So don't make any modeling decisions based on them--just use them for your evaluations.  Think about this as actually running the campaign with the choices you have made, and then evaluating the result.  SO... for making modeling choices (including selecting what algorithm to use and what you think it's AUC will be) you can use cross-validation on the training data (suggested below)."
