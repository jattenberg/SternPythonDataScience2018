    "## Part 1: Predicting IMDB movie review polarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a hot topic in data science right now due to the immense amount of user-generated text data being created every day online.  Businesses can now look at what is being said about them on review sites to get an idea of how well they are liked, how much they are disliked, and what they can do to improve.  While most of this data is unlabeled, some sites also ask users to provide a numerical or star rating.  This allows us to build a classifier for positive/negative reviews using the star rating as a label, which could then hypothetically applied to unlabeled text.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMDB collects information about movies and lets users write their own reviews, as well as provide a 1-10 numerical rating.  The data for this assignment can be found in hw4_IMDB.csv.  It consists of 12,500 positive and 12,500 negative reviews collected from IMDB.  The ratings have been binarized by labeling anything with score between 7 and 10 as “P” and anything between 1 and 4 with “N” (there are no “neutral” reviews in the data).  We will build and evaluate a system that classifies these movie reviews as positive or negative.\n"

Instead of classifying these reviews as positive or negative, we’ll now build a classifier to predict the star rating of a Yelp review from its text. Star rating prediction can be viewed either as a multiclass classification problem or a regression problem. For now we’ll treat it as multiclass classification.
